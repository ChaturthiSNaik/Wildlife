    <h2>Extinct Species</h2>
    <p>Extinct species are those that no longer exist on Earth, either in the wild or in captivity. The extinction of species is often a result of human activities, such as overhunting, habitat destruction, and the introduction of invasive species. Natural disasters and climate changes also contribute to the extinction of some species, but human influence has accelerated the process significantly in recent centuries. The loss of species like the Dodo and the Tasmanian Tiger serves as stark reminders of the irreversible consequences of neglecting biodiversity. Once a species goes extinct, it is impossible to bring it back, making conservation efforts for these species irrelevant. However, the extinction of one species can lead to the collapse of ecosystems, as these species often played critical roles in their environments. The extinction of top predators, for example, can cause an overpopulation of prey species, which in turn disrupts plant life and the overall food web. To prevent further extinctions, conservationists emphasize the need to protect endangered species and their habitats, creating more sustainable environments where species can thrive and avoid the fate of becoming extinct. The history of extinct species highlights the urgent need for responsible environmental management and greater awareness of the impact of human actions on the natural world.</p>
