    <h2>Endangered Species</h2>
    <p>Endangered species are those that are at serious risk of becoming extinct in the wild. These species face numerous challenges, such as habitat loss, poaching, pollution, and climate change. Human activities are often the primary drivers behind the rapid decline of these species. The loss of biodiversity has profound effects on ecosystems, and the extinction of species can lead to imbalances that disrupt food chains and affect other wildlife. The Endangered species category includes animals like the Amur Leopard and the Javan Rhino, both of which have seen dramatic reductions in their population numbers due to habitat destruction and illegal hunting. Protecting endangered species is crucial for maintaining the balance of ecosystems, as many of these species play key roles in their habitats, whether as predators, prey, or pollinators. Conservation efforts for endangered species often involve creating protected areas, implementing stricter laws against poaching, and supporting breeding programs to restore population numbers. Additionally, raising public awareness about the importance of protecting these species is vital to garner support for conservation initiatives. By focusing on endangered species, we help preserve not only individual animals but also the broader ecosystems that depend on them.</p>
