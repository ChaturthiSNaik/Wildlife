    <h2>Vulnerable Species</h2>
    <p>Vulnerable species are those that face a high risk of becoming endangered in the near future. While they are not yet classified as Endangered, these species are at significant risk due to various threats such as habitat loss, over-exploitation, and climate change. The African Elephant and the Giant Panda are examples of vulnerable species, with their populations declining due to human activities like poaching and habitat destruction. Vulnerability can be exacerbated by environmental changes, such as droughts or temperature shifts, which may affect food sources or breeding habits. The status of vulnerable species indicates that they require ongoing conservation efforts to prevent them from slipping into a more critical conservation status. Conservation programs for vulnerable species often focus on habitat protection, anti-poaching measures, and sustainable land use practices that minimize human impact on the environment. Additionally, breeding programs may be implemented to boost population numbers in captivity or protected areas. The conservation of vulnerable species is essential not only for protecting individual animals but also for maintaining the health of ecosystems. Many vulnerable species play important roles in their ecosystems, whether as predators, prey, or contributors to the natural balance. Effective conservation of these species is vital for sustaining biodiversity and ensuring that they do not become the next generation of endangered species.</p>
