    <h2>Endemic Species</h2>
    <p>Endemic species are those that are found only in a specific geographical location and are not naturally occurring anywhere else in the world. These species have evolved in isolation, adapting to unique environmental conditions in their habitats. Because they are limited to a specific area, they are often more vulnerable to extinction, especially when their habitat faces threats such as deforestation, climate change, or human expansion. Examples of endemic species include the Galápagos Tortoise and the Indian Peacock, both of which are found only in very specific regions. The preservation of endemic species is particularly important because they represent unique genetic diversity that cannot be found anywhere else. Protecting endemic species requires safeguarding the habitats in which they thrive, such as the forests, mountains, or islands where they are found. Additionally, conservation efforts should consider the impact of invasive species, which can often outcompete or prey on endemic species. As endemic species are often integral to their ecosystems, their loss can have ripple effects on other species that depend on them. Therefore, conserving these species is not just about protecting one species but ensuring the stability and health of the entire ecosystem in which they live.</p>
