    <h2>About Wildlife Conservation</h2>
    <p>Conservation status is a crucial tool used by scientists and conservationists to assess the risks faced by different species and to understand the extent of threats to biodiversity. It provides a framework for categorizing species based on their likelihood of survival in the wild. These categories, such as Endangered, Vulnerable, and Extinct, help raise awareness about the condition of species and ecosystems around the world. The goal is to identify species at risk and prioritize conservation efforts to protect them. By understanding the conservation status of a species, we can determine the causes of decline, whether it's due to habitat loss, poaching, climate change, or invasive species. Effective conservation strategies are essential for reducing these risks and ensuring that future generations can experience the richness of biodiversity. For example, species listed as Endangered require immediate attention and intervention, such as habitat restoration, anti-poaching efforts, and legal protection. Meanwhile, species in lower-risk categories, such as Least Concern, still benefit from ongoing conservation efforts to prevent them from slipping into more dangerous categories. Ultimately, conservation status serves as a call to action, urging individuals, governments, and organizations to take steps toward preserving the planet's wildlife and natural ecosystems.</p>
